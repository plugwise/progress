## Proposed change
Prepare integration for 'same brand, same integration' as set in #35713.
Basically this PR only slightly rearranges the code in preparation for adding USB connectivity. Translations will have the most impact from what I can test now.

There are two placeholder comments to indicate where future logic will be present in `Â§config_flow`.More details can be found in our ongoing (but substantially larger) beta-PR at (`config_flow` changes)[https://github.com/plugwise/plugwise-beta/pull/117/files#diff-579ef1fe8eaa9f4e6f36cff7cdad0747] where we will ask the user (unless network device discovery is used) to first select between USB or Network type of Plugwise product.
